											<h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
										Hello, I am Suhani! I am undergraduate student at Boston University, hoping to pursue tech! I am familiar with C++ (Arduino, Head of Software Engineering of FWP ROV Team), Python (Intermidiate, data analysis), HTML , CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I learned languages through applying and being a part of programs such as Headstarter SWE Fellowship, Kode With Klossy, and Girl's Who Code Programs, and participating in CS Classes offered at my High School. Based in Chicago, in my free time I love going for a quick walk near the lake, volunteering in events near me (election judge, dnc volunteering), and passionate about music! I hope to pursue CS, alongside a more humanties focuesed intersection like Economics or Political Science, using CS for the good of humanties.

										<h3>Kode With Klossy</h3>
										<p> Was a Kode With Klossy Scholar during the Summer of 2023 (Ai and ML) and Summer of 2024 (Data Science). In 2023, I created an Ai image classifier mobile app, using Swift and CodeML, classifying between Plastic and Sea Jellies on the West Coast Shore. In 2024, I create a data visualization website, analysing health care breaches and the importance of protecting medical records. </p>

										<h3>Headstarter SWE Fellowship</h3>
										<p>Currently I am a Headstarter SWE Fellowship on Track A of the program hoping to get 1000 people on a waitlist, 1000 acounts created or $1000 of revenue created. Through colaborating with undergraduate students from Yale, University of Virginia, and Rutgers University, I hope to gain a perspective of how a career in SWE looks like and some marketing skills. </p>
									</li>

										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>MATE ROV</h3>
										<p>I was the Head of Software Engineering of my High School's Underwater Robotic, going to the international mate rov competition twice with my team! Being a part of ROV, I have learn how to code an arduino, microcontroller, using python and c++ intertwinned. I have learned how to program a joystick to exectute specific comands, and have programed camera's using rasberry pi. </p>
